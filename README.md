# InfinityFreeDeploy
Autodeploy to InfinityFree using github actions and FTP
In this repo you will find a document explaining the steps to setup your autodeploy to infinifyFree hosting service, used for PHP and MySQL.

After pushing to the desired branch (must be a public repo), then the code will be sent over to the infinity free server using FTP secure connection.



Automation is a one way trip, once you learn there is no going back to doing thing manually
