<h1># FTP Deploy using GitHub Actions</h1>
<h2>Send via secure FTP the commits to your public repository</h2>

This repo contains a PDF (currently only in Spanish due to lack of time) with steps, images and a little introduction/explanation on how to setup your autodeploy to infinifyFree hosting service. It also includes the file with the code for you to copy to your repository, create the repository secrets and you are good to go! 

After pushing to the desired branch (must belong to a public repo), then the code will be sent over to the server via FTP secure connection.



<h3>Automation is a one way trip</h3>
once you learn there is no going back to doing thing manually
